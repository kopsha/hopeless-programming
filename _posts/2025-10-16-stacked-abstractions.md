# [The Great Abstraction Tragedy #1]

## Stacked Abstractions

_once we coded_  
_now we configure_

---

**1992:**  
You wrote C.  
You compiled.  
It ran.  
You felt unstoppable.

Your tools?  
A terminal, a manual, and a terrifying sense of responsibility.

**2025:**  
You write YAML that describes JSON  
that configures Docker  
that runs Node  
that calls Python  
that imports a C library written in 1992.

It doesn’t work.  
You open GitHub.  
Last commit: "Temporary fix." (from 2018).

Back then, a *stack* meant stack memory.  
Now it means 17 logos in a slide deck.

We used to count bytes.  
Now we count dependencies.  
And lose both battles.

We say we're standing on the shoulders of giants,  
but really we're balancing on a pile of abstractions,  
frameworks, and an alarming amount of duct tape.  
And somewhere at the bottom,  
a 30-year-old C function still runs  
silently, perfectly,  
and completely undocumented.

We didn’t simplify computing.  
We just moved the complexity further away from the keyboard.  
But hey, at least it deploys in a container.  
And has dark mode.
