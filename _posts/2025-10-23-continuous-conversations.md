# 🚧 The Great Abstraction Tragedy 🚧 #2

## Continuous Conversations

_where velocity means_  
_talking faster_

---

**2003:**  
We discovered Agile.  
It was fresh. It was rebellious.  
*"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools."*  
We believed.

Meetings were short.  
Code was long.  
And "velocity" meant momentum, not metrics.

**2025:**  
We stand up.  
We circle around the same virtual board.  
We say the same three things in slightly different words.  
Someone shares their screen.  
No one shares their soul.

Back then, Agile was about trust.  
Now it's about tracking.

Back then, retrospectives meant reflection.  
Now, they mean calendar invites.

We call it "continuous improvement".  
But mostly, it's just continuous conversation.

We didn't kill waterfall.  
We just made it circular.

The stand-up never ends.  
It just rotates through time zones.

And somewhere,  
in the quiet hours between meetings...  
Code still gets written.  
Not by the process, not by AI agents...  
By humans.
