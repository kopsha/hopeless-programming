# ðŸš§ [The Great Abstraction Tragedy #3]

## Automation Anxiety

_when bots deploy_  
_and we just watch_

---

**2010**:  
You SSH into a server.  
You deploy a build.  
You pray.

You knew what every script did,  
because you wrote every script.

---

**2025**:  
You push to main.  
Pipelines trigger pipelines.  
Bots talk to bots.  
Slack celebrates a deployment nobody understands.

The system works  
until it doesn't.  
Then everyone watches dashboards  
like medieval priests reading omens.

---

We used to say "_automate the boring stuff_".  
Now the boring stuff runs forever,  
and we're the ones waiting,  
watching, guessing.

We have observability, alerting, orchestration, and chaos testing  
but if you ask why something broke,  
the answer is usually:
> "Because we automated away the understanding."

---

We didn't eliminate toil.  
We just abstracted it.  
Wrapped it in YAML.  
Called it DevOps,
and congratulated ourselves on moving faster.

But somewhere, in every company,  
a junior engineer asks:
> "So... what actually happens after I push?"  
> And the room goes quiet.
