**2010**:  
You SSH into a server.  
You deploy a build.  
You pray.

You knew what every script did,  
because you wrote every script.

---

**2025**:  
You push to main.  
Pipelines trigger pipelines.  
Bots talk to bots.  
Slack celebrates a deployment nobody understands.

The system works  
until it doesn't.
Then everyone watches dashboards  
like medieval priests reading omens.

We used to say _"automate the boring stuff"_.  
Now the boring stuff runs forever,  
and we're the ones waiting,
watching, guessing.

We have observability, alerting, orchestration, and chaos testing  
but if you ask why something broke,  
the answer is usually:
> "Because we automated the part that knew why it worked."

---

We didn't eliminate toil.  
We just abstracted it.  
Wrapped it in YAML.  
Called it DevOps,
and congratulated ourselves on moving faster.

But somewhere, in every company,  
a junior engineer asks:
> "So... what actually happens after I push?"  
> And the room goes quiet.
