## DevOps: We automated everything, except understanding

---

**2010**:  
You SSH into a server.  
You deploy a build.  
You pray.

You knew what every script did,  
because you wrote every script.

---

**2025**:  
You push to main.  
Pipelines trigger pipelines.  
Bots talk to bots.  
Slack celebrates a deployment nobody understands.

The system works  
until it doesn't.

Then everyone watches dashboards  
like medieval priests reading omens.

---

We used to say _"automate the boring stuff"_.  
Now the boring stuff runs forever,  
and we're the ones waiting.

We have observability, alerting, orchestration, and chaos testing  
but if you ask why something broke,  
the answer is usually:
> "Because we automated the part that knew why it worked."

---

We didn't eliminate toil.  
We just abstracted it.  
Wrapped it in YAML.  
And called it DevOps.

Somewhere, a junior engineer asks,
> "Soâ€¦ what actually happens after I push?"  
> And the room goes quiet.
