## Chaos Is a Feature Sanity Is Optional

Your code will fail. The universe doesn't care. Bugs are inevitable. Warnings are
meaningless. If you want order, go somewhere else - here, chaos rules and sanity
is a forgotten concept.

If you want to become the Rick Sanchez of programming, congratulations - you're home.  

It is not really hard:
- make your code slightly more twisted than necessary and watch the chaos unfold
- find some generalisation that will allow you to reuse three lines of code in
  two places by creating a method that accepts five parameters
- maybe you can reduce three lines of code into one by using a clever triple
  nested ternary operator
- or maybe you can use chained functions, nested conditional statements,
  over-bloated design patterns and clever one-liners that use niche hipster
  features of your favourite language.

The sky is the limit!

Of course, it will make the application harder to read and maintain but that will
probably be your coworkers’ problem, right?
Excellent! So give it a go and write a code that proves you’re a real hacker...
