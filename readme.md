# Hopeless Programming

Welcome, fellow code anarchist. You've entered **Hopeless Programming** — a
place where bugs are friends, warnings are jokes, and logic is strictly optional.
If your code isn't confusing someone, somewhere, are you even programming?


## What This Is

This is a blog. A playground. A manifesto.  

Here you'll find:  
- Over-engineered one-liners  
- Nested horrors of conditional madness  
- Design patterns nobody asked for  
- Obscure language features exploited in ways that will make your coworkers cry

Basically: code like Rick would, if he wrote for the web.  


## Getting Started (If You Insist)

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:kopsha/hopeless-programming.git
   ```
1. Install Jekyll (if you don’t already have it):
   ```bash
   gem install jekyll bundler
   ```
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```
1. Build and serve the site locally:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
1. Open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser and bask in the glorious
   absurdity of unnecessarily complicated code.


## Contributing

Want to make the chaos worse? Pull requests are welcome:
Add posts to the _posts folder (or equivalent)
Keep the tone sarcastic, nihilistic, and slightly dangerous

Remember: readability is for mortals


## License

MIT — meaning you can do whatever you want, just like your code.
Break things. Confuse people. Laugh at the universe. Repeat.
